		"content" : "Our team's idea is to add emojis to the post system. For example, angry emoji, happy emoji, sad emoji, etc. The reason why the emoji function is needed is that simple text may cause others to misunderstand your meaning. For example, when you lend your computer to a friend and when he returns the computer to you, you found that there is a problem with the computer. When you simply asking your friend about the issue with the computer, your friend may misunderstand that you are angry with him. Because computers are valuable items, most people will get angry when their computers having a issue. Therefore, adding emoji function can make people understand the tone of the message and let people better understand the meaning of the message. In addition to emojis use to express tone, GIF or picture functions can also be added. Users only need to provide a URL of the picture or GIF to make the it appear on the post."
